# i18n-ai-extractor README

This VS Code extension utilizes AI to extract locale keys from your code, specifically designed for projects with hard-coded strings looking to transition to i18n. The extension assists in identifying all hard-coded strings and replacing them with locale keys.
It leverages AI to scan the source file, detecting unlocalized text and suggesting corresponding i18n keys for users.
